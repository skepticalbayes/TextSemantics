## Understanding Contextualised word embeddings

We had a breakthrough moment in NLP with **universal word embeddings using GLOVE and word2vec** which understood universal semanitcs but we can't account for linguistic **polysemy**, ie. the word "back" has different semantics(meaning) "my back hurts" and "going back outdoors for a jog".

We countered this issue with the contextualised embeddings (BERT and elmo being major implementations of this abstract notion), and we further scaled this idea to form embeddings for variable length sentences/ phrases which captured the context of the text.

We will explore how these embeddings make sense by visualising some phrases on the 2D cartesian plane.
